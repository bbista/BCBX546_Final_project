# CONDO pipeline for Cufflinks## The author provided the reads form illumine sequencing and the genome and genome annotation for Drosophila melanogaster was downloaded from NCBI. Due to the extremely large file sizes they cannot be saved into the repository. ##The reads will be available through the original paper. ## Inspecting data using FASTQC`FASTQC.sbatch`## Trimming the reads using Trimmomatic`trim.sbatch`## Using tophat to map trimmed reads to the genome`tophat.sbatch`## Cufflinks assembles transcriptomes from RNA-Seq data and quantifies their expression`cufflinks.sbatch`## Cuffmerge to merge diferrent gtf file from Cufflinks`cuffmerge.sbatch`##cuffdiff to generate the cuffdiff output for CummeRbund`cuffdiff.sbatch`
